## Requirements

* **decentralized/self-sovereign** (encryption, signing, authn, and authz should all be based on control of DIDs rather than on CAs, IDPs, etc)

* **transport independent** (HTTPS, bluetooth, AMQP, SMTP, NFC, and so forth)

* **routable** (like email, A can talk to B without a direct connection to B, by requesting that a message be forwarded--needed to mix and match transports; also, could pass through a mix network or other infrastructure that isn’t aware of it as anything other than blobs to be moved)

* **secure** (tamper-proof, MITM impossible, composed of primitives widely considered best practice, vetted by experts, has formal security proofs, security guarantees of a given message are known)

* **private** (third parties can’t learn who’s communicating about what, when--broader than “confidentiality” in CIA {huh what does this mean?} because metadata like timing and identities of parties is also protected; also, possible for a sender to be anonymous to recipient) 

* **asynchronous** (can’t require real-time participation by a party; like email in that parties can communicate when they want)

* **supports simplex and duplex** (can’t assume response uses the same channel as request--but allows request~response where desirable)

* **supports repudiable and non-repudiable** (parties can talk off or on the record, as appropriate)

* **platform-independent** (usable on embedded, not just servers+desktops+mobile)

* **composable** (pick the crypto suite and features you need, without incurring overwhelming dependencies for stuff you don’t) {this would seemingly require some form of negotiation, similar to what happens in TLS.   What if the sender decided to cipher the message with SecretSquirrelLevel10 algo and the recipient cant handle that algo for any number of reasons (export controls, etc)?}

* **pairwise, nwise, anywise** (communicate between 2 parties, or between N parties, or to the whole world)

* **efficient** (doesn’t waste bandwidth, storage space, cpu, etc)
