## Summary

Agents need to use a common set of algorithms when exchanging and persisting data. This RFC supplies a cipher suite and examples for DIDComm envelopes.

## Motivation

The goal of this RFC is define ciphersuites for Anoncrypt and Authcrypt such that we can achieve better compatability with JOSE. We also aim to supply both a compliant suite and a constrained device suite. The compliant suite is suitable for implementations that contain AES hardware acceleration or desire to use NIST / FIPS algorithms (where possible).

## Encryption Algorithms

The next two sub-sections describe the encryption algorithms that must be supported. On devices with AES hardware acceleration or requiring compliance, AES GCM is the recommended algorithm. Otherwise, XChacha20Poly1305 should be used.

### Content Encryption Algorithms

The following table defines the supported content encryption algorithms for DIDComm JWE envelopes:

 Content Encryption   | Encryption Algorithm identifier
 :------------------  | :-------------------
 AES-GCM (256 bit)    | A256GCM
 XChacha20Poly1305    | XC20P

### Key Encryption Algorithms

The following table defines the supported key wrapping encryption algorithms for DIDComm JWE envelopes:

 Key Encryption                 | Encryption algorithm identifier   | Anoncrypt/Authcrypt
 :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :--------------------
 ECDH-ES + AES key wrap         | ECDH-ES+A256KW                    | Anoncrypt
 ECDH-1PU + AES key wrap        | ECDH-1PU+A256KW                   | Authcrypt


### Curves support

The following curves are supported:

 Curve Name                                                 | Curve identifier
 :--------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------
 X25519 (aka Curve25519)                                    | X25519 (default)
 NIST P256 (aka SECG secp256r1 and ANSI X9.62 prime256v1, ref [here](https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4492#appendix-A))   | P-256

Other curves are optional.

#### Security Consideration for Curves

As noted in the ECDH-1PU [IETF draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-02#section-4) security considerations section, all implementations must ensure the following:
```text
When performing an ECDH key agreement between a static private key
and any untrusted public key, care should be taken to ensure that the
public key is a valid point on the same curve as the private key.
Failure to do so may result in compromise of the static private key.
For the NIST curves P-256, P-384, and P-521, appropriate validation
routines are given in Section 5.6.2.3.3 of [NIST.800-56A]. For the
curves used by X25519 and X448, consult the security considerations
of [RFC7748].
```


### JWE Examples

AES GCM encryption and key wrapping examples are found in [Appendix C](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#appendix-C) of the JSON Web Algorithm specs.

The Proposed [JWE Formats](#jwe-formats) below lists a combination of content encryption and key wrapping algorithms formats.

## Drawbacks

- All new algorithm identifiers should be registered at IANA.
  - XC20P
  - ECDH-1PU+A256KW (already in IETF draft)
- Security Considerations of [ECDH-1PU](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-02) (Section 4)
- X25519 is not yet part of SP 800-56A. See [NIST post](https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2017/Transition-Plans-for-Key-Establishment-Schemes) for more information.

## Rationale and alternatives

Our approach for AuthCrypt compliance is to use the NIST approved `One-Pass Unified Model for ECDH` scheme described in [SP 800-56A Rev. 3](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-56a/rev-3/final). The JOSE version is defined as `ECDH-1PU` in this [IETF draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-02).

Aries agents currently use the envelope described in [RFC0019](/features/0019-encryption-envelope/README.md). This envelope uses libsodium (NaCl) encryption/decryption, which is based on Salsa20Poly1305 algorithm.

Another prior effort towards enhancing JWE compliance is to use XChacha20Poly1305 encryption and ECDH-SS key wrapping mode. See Aries-RFCs [issue-133](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/133#issuecomment-535199768) and [Go JWE Authcrypt package](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/tree/v0.1.0/pkg/didcomm/packer/jwe/authcrypt) for an implementation detail. As ECDH-SS is not specified by JOSE, a new recipient header field, `spk`, was needed to contain the static encrypted public key of the sender. Additionally (X)Chacha20Poly1305 key wrapping is also not specified by JOSE. For these reasons, this option is mentioned here as reference only.

## JWE formats

### Anoncrypt using ECDH-ES key wrapping mode and XC20P content encryption

```json
 {
  "protected": base64url({
      "typ": "didcomm-envelope-enc",
      "enc": "XC20P", // or "A256GCM"
  }),
  "recipients": [
    {
      "header": {
        "kid": base64url(recipient KID), // e.g: base64url("urn:123")
        "alg": "ECDH-ES+A256KW",
        "epk": { // defining X25519 key as an example JWK, but this can be AES-GCM 256-bit key as well 
          "kty": "OKP",
          "crv": "X25519",
          "x": "-3bLMSHYDG3_LVNh-MJvoYs_a2sAEPr4jwFfFjTrmUo" // sender's ephemeral public key value base64url encoded
        },
        "apu": epk.x value above,
        "apv": base64url(recipient.kid)
      },
      "encrypted_key": "Sls6zrMW335GJsJe0gJU4x1HYC4TRBZS1kTS1GATEHfH_xGpNbrYLg"
    }
  ],
  "iv": "K0PfgxVxLiW0Dslx",
  "ciphertext": "Sg",
  "tag": "PP31yGbQGBz9zgq9kAxhCA"
}
```

`typ` header field is the DIDComm Transports value as mentioned in [RFC-0025](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0025-didcomm-transports#reference). This RFC states the prefix `application/` but according to [IANA Media types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#application) the prefix is implied therefore not needed here.

### Anoncrypt using ECDH-ES key wrapping mode and A256GCM content encryption

```json
{
  "protected": base64url({
          "typ": "didcomm-envelope-enc",
          "enc": "A256GCM", // "XC20P"
  }),
  "recipients": [
    {
      "header": {
        "kid": base64url(recipient KID),
        "alg": "ECDH-ES+A256KW",
        "epk": {
          "kty": "OKP",
          "crv": "X25519",
          "x": "aOH-76BRwkHf0nbGokaBsO6shW9McEs6jqVXaF0GNn4" // sender's ephemeral public key value base64url encoded
        },
        "apu": epk.x value above,
        "apv": base64url(recipient.kid)
      },
      "encrypted_key": "wXzKi-XXb6fj_KSY5BR5hTUsZIiAQKrxblTo3d50B1KIeFwBR98fzQ"
    }
  ],
  "iv": "9yjR8zvgeQDZFbIS",
  "ciphertext": "EvIk_Rr6Nd-0PqQ1LGimSqbKyx_qZjGnmt6nBDdCWUcd15yp9GTeYqN_q_FfG7hsO8c",
  "tag": "9wP3dtNyJERoR7FGBmyF-w"
}
```

In the above two examples, `apu` is the encode ephemeral key used to encrypt the cek stored in `encrypted_key` and `apv` is the key id of the static public key of the recipient. Both are base64Url encoded.
`kid` is the value of a key ID in a DID document that should be resolvable to fetch the raw public key used.

### Authcrypt using ECDH-1PU key wrapping mode

```json
{
    "protected": base64url({
        "typ": "didcomm-envelope-enc",
        "enc":"XC20P", // or "A256GCM"
        "skid": base64url(sender KID),
    }),
    "recipients": [
        {
            "encrypted_key": "base64url(encrypted CEK)",
            "header": {
                "kid": base64url(recipient KID),
                "alg": "ECDH-1PU+A256KW",
                "enc": "A256GCM",
                "apu": base64url(senderID),
                "apv": base64url(recipientID),
                "epk": {
                  "kty": "OKP",
                  "crv": "X25519",
                  "x": "aOH-76BRwkHf0nbGokaBsO6shW9McEs6jqVXaF0GNn4"
                },
            }
        },
       ...
    ],
    "aad": "base64url(sha256(concat('.',sort([recipients[0].kid, ..., recipients[n].kid])))))",
    "iv": "base64url(content encryption IV)",
    "ciphertext": "base64url(XC20P(DIDComm payload, base64Url(json($protected)+'.'+$aad), content encryption IV, CEK))"
    "tag": "base64url(AEAD Authentication Tag)"
}
```

With the recipients headers representing an ephemeral key that can be used to derive the key to be used for AEAD decryption of the CEK following the [ECDH-1PU](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-02) encryption scheme.

The function `XC20P` in the example above is defined as the XChahcha20Poly1035 cipher function. This can be replaced by the A256GCM cipher function.

## JWE detached mode nested envelopes

There are situations in DIDComm messaging where an envelope could be nested inside another envelope -- particularly [RFC 46: Mediators and Relays](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0046-mediators-and-relays). Normally nesting envelopes implies that the envelope payloads will incur additional encryption and encoding operations at each parent level in the nesting. This section describes a mechanism to extract the nested payloads outside the nesting structure to avoid these additional operations.

### Detached mode

JWS defines [detached mode](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#appendix-F) where the payload can be removed. As stated in IETF RFC7515, this strategy has the following benefit:

> Note that this method needs no support from JWS libraries, as
  applications can use this method by modifying the inputs and outputs
  of standard JWS libraries.

We will leverage a similar detached mode for JWE in the mechanism described below.

### Mechanism

Sender:

1. Creates the "final" JWE intended for the recipient (normal JWE operation).
2. Extracts the ciphertext and replace with an empty string.
3. Creates the nested envelopes around the "final" JWE (but with the empty string ciphertext).
4. Sends the nested envelope (normal JWE) plus the ciphertext from the "final" JWE.

Mediator:

1. Decrypt their layer (normal JWE operation). The detached ciphertext(s) are filtered out prior to invoking the JWE library (normal JWE structure).
2. Remove the next detached ciphertext from the structure and insert back into the ciphertext field for the next nesting level.

Receiver:

1. Decrypts the "final" JWE (normal JWE operation).

The detached ciphertext steps are repeated at each nesting level. In this case, an array of ciphertexts is sent along with the nested envelope.

This solution has the following characteristics:

- Only encrypts the payload once.
- JWE headers and metadata are included in the nested envelope's ciphertext.
- Needs no support from JWE libraries.
- Requires a serialization structure for transporting both the nesting JWE and the detached ciphertexts (only when there is a nested envelope). See below.
- Requires some minor additional logic prior to invoking the JWE library.

### Serialization

The extracted ciphertext serialization format should have additional thought for both compact and JSON modes. As a starting point:

- Compact mode: Each extracted ciphertext is appended to the end of the serialized "final" JWE (using dot seperation). These extracted cipher texts are ordered according to the nesting (from innermost to outermost).
- JSON mode: The extracted ciphertext are placed into a JSON array. These extracted cipher texts are ordered according to the nesting (from innermost to outermost). The array is appended to the "final" JWE object as the `detached_ciphertext` field.

For illustration, the following compact serialization represents nesting due to two mediators (the second mediator being closest to the Receiver).

First Mediator receives:
```
  BASE64URL(UTF8(JWE Protected Header for First Mediator)) || '.' ||
  BASE64URL(JWE Encrypted Key for First Mediator) || '.' ||
  BASE64URL(JWE Initialization Vector for First Mediator) || '.' ||
  BASE64URL(JWE Ciphertext for First Mediator) || '.' ||
  BASE64URL(JWE Authentication Tag for First Mediator) || '.' ||
  BASE64URL(JWE Ciphertext for Receiver) || '.' ||
  BASE64URL(JWE Ciphertext for Second Mediator)
```

Second Mediator receives:
```
  BASE64URL(UTF8(JWE Protected Header for Second Mediator)) || '.' ||
  BASE64URL(JWE Encrypted Key for Second Mediator) || '.' ||
  BASE64URL(JWE Initialization Vector for Second Mediator) || '.' ||
  BASE64URL(JWE Ciphertext for Second Mediator) || '.' ||
  BASE64URL(JWE Authentication Tag for Second Mediator) || '.' ||
  BASE64URL(JWE Ciphertext for Receiver)
```

Finally the Receiver has a normal JWE (as usual):
```
  BASE64URL(UTF8(JWE Protected Header for Receiver)) || '.' ||
  BASE64URL(JWE Encrypted Key for Receiver) || '.' ||
  BASE64URL(JWE Initialization Vector for Receiver) || '.' ||
  BASE64URL(JWE Ciphertext for Receiver) || '.' ||
  BASE64URL(JWE Authentication Tag for Receiver)
```

This illustration extends the serialization shown in [RFC 7516](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516#section-3.1).

## Unresolved questions

- What fields should Key identifiers in ES and 1PU key wrapping modes use? `kid` vs `id` (vs `skid` introduced in [ECDH-1PU](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-02) IETF document) or any other combination of fields. There is a discussion about this [here](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/131).
- What kind of keys to include in the JWE envelope? `Encryption` or `signing` keys? Currently the existing Aries agents include `signing` keys for the sender and recipients and convert them to encryption keys for encryption/decryption operations only. The drawback is the envelope transmitted by the agent contains signing keys. The aries-framework-go repo includes (an experimental) JWE implementation that expects `signing` keys from the API user and then fetches the corresponding `encryption` keys from the wallet (KMS) to build the envelope. `Signing` keys are not included in the envelope in this implementation. There is a need to separate them from `encryption` keys in the current Aries implementations as well.
