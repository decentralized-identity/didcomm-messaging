### Connections

A Connection is the practical application of a relationship in DID Communication. Having a connection means that each party in the relationship has a DID for the other parties, and parties can communicate securely using the keys and endpoints within each DID Document.

In order to establish a new connection, Simply exchange a new message between parties. Knowing the DID of the other parties does not indicate any level of trust. Using the connection to establish a foundation of trust is the next step.
