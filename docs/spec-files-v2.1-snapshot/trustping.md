### Trust Ping Protocol 2.0

This protocol is a standard way for agents to test connectivity,
responsiveness, and security of a DIDComm channel. It is analogous to the familiar `ping` command in networking &mdash; but because it operates
over DIDComm, it is transport agnostic and asynchronous, and it can produce insights into privacy and security that a regular ping cannot.

The [PIURI](#protocol-identifier-uri) for this protocol is:

    https://didcomm.org/trust-ping/2.0

#### Roles

There are two parties in a trust ping: the `sender`
and the `receiver`. The sender initiates the trust
ping. The receiver responds. If the receiver wants
to do a ping of their own, they can, but this is a
new interaction in which they become the sender.

#### Messages

##### ping

The trust ping interaction begins when `sender`
creates a `ping` message like this:

```JSON
{
  "type": "https://didcomm.org/trust-ping/2.0/ping",
  "id": "518be002-de8e-456e-b3d5-8fe472477a86",
  "from": "did:example:123456",
  "body": {
      "response_requested": true
  }
}
```

**response_requested**: default value is `true`. If false, the `sender` is not requesting a `ping-response` from the `receiver`. If `true`, the `sender` is requesting a response.

##### ping-response

When the message arrives at the receiver, assuming that `response_requested`
is not `false`, the receiver should reply as quickly as possible with a
`ping-response` message that looks like this:

```JSON
{
  "type": "https://didcomm.org/trust-ping/2.0/ping-response",
  "id": "e002518b-456e-b3d5-de8e-7a86fe472847",
  "thid": "518be002-de8e-456e-b3d5-8fe472477a86"
}
```

#### Trust

This is the "**trust** ping protocol", not just the "ping protocol."
The "trust" in its name comes from several features that the interaction
gains by virtue of the properties of the DIDComm messages. A ping and response verify to both parties that the necessary encryption is in place and working properly for the messages to be understood.
