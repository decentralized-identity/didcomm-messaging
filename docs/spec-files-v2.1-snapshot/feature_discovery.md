### Discover Features Protocol 2.0

This protocol helps agents query one another to discover which features they support, and to what extent.

The identifier for the message family used by this protocol is `discover-features`, and the fully qualified [PIURI](#protocol-identifier-uri) for its definition is:

    https://didcomm.org/discover-features/2.0

#### Motivation

Though some agents will support just one protocol and will be statically configured to interact with just one other party, many exciting uses of agents are more dynamic and unpredictable. When Alice and Bob meet, they won't know in advance which features are supported by one another's agents. They need a way to find out.

Disclosing features in this manner has a significant privacy benefit over endpoint disclosures contained in a DID document published to a Verifiable Data Registry (VDR). Using the single DIDComm endpoint published in the document and this protocol, features can be selectively disclosed to other parties at the owner's discretion. The problem of anonymous scanning and fingerprinting enabled with VDR disclosures is solved in a privacy preserving way.

#### Roles

There are two roles in the `discover-features` protocol: `requester` and `responder`. The requester asks the responder about the protocols it supports, and the responder answers. Each role uses a single message type.

It is also possible to proactively disclose features; in this case a requester receives a disclosure without asking for it. This may eliminate some chattiness in certain use cases (e.g., where two-way connectivity is limited).

#### States

This is a classic two-step request~response interaction, so it uses the predefined state machines for any `requester` and `responder`:

#### Messages

###### `query` Message Type

A `discover-features/query` message looks like this:

```json
{
    "type": "https://didcomm.org/discover-features/2.0/queries",
    "id": "yWd8wfYzhmuXX3hmLNaV5bVbAjbWaU",
    "body": {
        "queries": [
            { "feature-type": "protocol", "match": "https://didcomm.org/tictactoe/1.*" },
            { "feature-type": "goal-code", "match": "org.didcomm.*" }
        ]
    }
}
```

Queries messages contain one or more **query objects** in the `queries` array. Each query essentially says, "Please tell me what features of type X you support, where the feature identifiers match this (potentially wildcarded) string." This particular example asks an agent if it supports any 1.x versions of a tictactoe protocol, and if it supports any [goal codes](#goal-codes) that begin with "org.didcomm.".

Implementations of this protocol must recognize the following values for `feature-type`: `protocol`, `goal-code`,  and `header`.  Additional values of `feature-type` may be used, and unrecognized values MUST be ignored.

Identifiers are used as the value to match against a feature type. Their format varies. For protocols, identifiers are PIURIs. For [goal codes](#goal-codes), identifiers are goal code values. For governance frameworks, identifiers are URIs where the framework is published. For headers, identifiers are header names.

The `match` field of a query descriptor may use the * wildcard. By itself, a `match` with just the wildcard says, "I'm interested in anything you want to share with me." But usually, this wildcard will be to match a prefix that's a little more specific, as in the example that matches any 1.x version.

Any agent may send another agent this message type at any time. Implementers of agents that intend to support dynamic relationships and rich features are *strongly* encouraged to implement support for this message, as it is likely to be among the first messages exchanged with a stranger.

###### `disclose` Message Type

A `discover-features/disclose` message looks like this:

```json
{
    "type": "https://didcomm.org/discover-features/2.0/disclose",
    "thid": "yWd8wfYzhmuXX3hmLNaV5bVbAjbWaU",
    "body":{
        "disclosures": [
            {
                "feature-type": "protocol",
                "id": "https://didcomm.org/tictactoe/1.0",
                "roles": ["player"]
            },
            {
                "feature-type": "goal-code",
                "id": "org.didcomm.sell.goods.consumer"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The `disclosures` field is a JSON array of zero or more **disclosure objects** that describe a feature. Each descriptor has a `feature-type` field that contains data corresponding to `feature-type` in a query object, and an `id` field that unambiguously identifies a single item of that feature type. When the item is a protocol, the disclosure object may also contain a `roles` array that enumerates the roles the responding agent can play in the associated protocol. Future feature types may add additional optional fields, though no other fields are being standardized with this version of the spec.

Disclosures messages say, "Here are some features I support (that matched your queries)."

###### Sparse Responses

Disclosures do not have to contain exhaustive detail. For example, the following response omits the optional `roles` field but may be just as useful as one that includes it:

```json
{
  "type": "https://didcomm.org/discover-features/2.0/disclose",
  "thid": "yWd8wfYzhmuXX3hmLNaV5bVbAjbWaU",
    "body": {
        "disclosures": [
            {"feature-type": "protocol", "id": "https://didcomm.org/tictactoe/1.0"}
        ]
    }
}
```

Less detail probably suffices because agents do not need to know everything about one another's implementations in order to start an interaction &mdash; usually the flow will organically reveal what's needed. For example, the `outcome` message in the `tictactoe` protocol isn't needed until the end, and is optional anyway. Alice can start a tictactoe game with Bob and will eventually see whether he has the right idea about `outcome` messages.

The missing `roles` in this disclosure does not say, "I support no roles in this protocol." It says, "I support the protocol but I'm providing no detail about specific roles." Similar logic applies to any other omitted fields.

An empty `disclosures` array does not say, "I support no features that match your query." It says, "I'm not disclosing to you that I support any features (that match your query)." An agent might not tell another that it supports a feature for various reasons, including: the trust that it imputes to the other party based on cumulative interactions so far, whether it's in the middle of upgrading a plugin, whether it's currently under high load, and so forth. And responses to a `discover-features` query are not guaranteed to be true forever; agents can be upgraded or downgraded, although they probably won't churn in their feature profiles from moment to moment.

#### Privacy Considerations

Because the wildcards in a `queries` message can be very inclusive, the `discover-features` protocol could be used to mine information suitable for agent fingerprinting, in much the same way that browser fingerprinting works. This is antithetical to the ethos of our ecosystem, and represents bad behavior. Agents should use `discover-features` to answer legitimate questions, and not to build detailed profiles of one another. However, fingerprinting may be attempted anyway.

For agents that want to maintain privacy, several best practices are recommended:

##### Follow selective disclosure.

Only reveal supported features based on trust in the relationship. Even if you support a protocol, you may not wish to use it in every relationship. Don't tell others about features you do not plan to use with them.

Patterns are easier to see in larger data samples. However, a pattern of ultra-minimal data is also a problem, so use good judgment about how forthcoming to be.

##### Vary the format of responses.

Sometimes, you might prettify your agent plaintext message one way, sometimes another.

##### Vary the order of items in the `disclosures` array.

If more than one key matches a query, do not always return them in alphabetical order or version order. If you do return them in order, do not always return them in ascending order.

##### Consider adding some spurious details.

If a query could match multiple features, then occasionally you might add some made-up features as matches. If a wildcard allows multiple versions of a protocol, then sometimes you might use some made-up *versions*. And sometimes not. (Doing this too aggressively might reveal your agent implementation, so use sparingly.)

##### Vary how you query, too.

How you ask questions may also be fingerprintable.
