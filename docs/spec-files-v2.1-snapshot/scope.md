## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of DIDComm Messaging is to provide a secure, private communication methodology built atop the decentralized design of <u><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a></u>.

It is the second half of this sentence, not the first, that makes DIDComm interesting. "Methodology" implies more than just a mechanism for individual messages, or even for a sequence of them. DIDComm Messaging defines how messages compose into the larger primitive of [application-level protocols](#protocols) and workflows, while seamlessly retaining trust. "Built atop ... DIDs" emphasizes DIDComm's connection to the larger decentralized identity movement, with its many attendent virtues.

Of course, robust mechanisms for secure communication already exist. However, most rely on key registries, identity providers, certificate authorities, browser or app vendors, or similar centralizations. Many are for unstructured rich chat only &mdash; or enable value-add behaviors through proprietary extensions. Many also assume a single transport, making it difficult to use the same solution for human and machine conversations, online and offline, simplex and duplex, across a broad set of modalities. And because these limitations constantly matter, composability is limited &mdash; every pairing of human and machine for new purposes requires a new endpoint, a new API, and new trust. Workflows that span these boundaries are rare and difficult.

All of these factors perpetuate an asymmetry between institutions and ordinary people. The former maintain certificates and always-connected servers, and publish APIs under terms and conditions they dictate; the latter suffer with usernames and passwords, poor interoperability, and a Hobson's choice between privacy and convenience.

DIDComm Messaging can fix these problems. Using DIDComm, individuals on semi-connected mobile devices become full peers of highly available web servers operated by IT experts. Registration is self-service, intermediaries require little trust, and terms and conditions can come from any party.

DIDComm Messaging enables higher-order protocols that inherit its security, privacy, decentralization, and transport independence. Examples include exchanging verifiable credentials, creating and maintaining relationships, buying and selling, scheduling events, negotiating contracts, voting, presenting tickets for travel, applying to employers or schools or banks, arranging healthcare, and playing games. Like web services atop HTTP, the possibilities are endless; unlike web services atop HTTP, many parties can participate without being clients of a central server, and they can use a mixture of connectivity models and technologies. And these protocols are composable into higher-order workflows without constantly reinventing the way trust and identity transfer across boundaries.

### Overview

To understand how DIDComm Messaging works, consider a situation where Alice wants to negotiate with Bob to sell something online. Because DIDComm, not direct human communication, is the methodology in this example, Alice's software agent and Bob's software agent are going to exchange a series of messages.

Alice may just press a button and be unaware of details, but underneath, her agent begins by preparing a [plaintext JSON message](#didcomm-plaintext-messages) about the proposed sale. *The particulars of selling are irrelevant here, but would be described in the spec for a higher-level "sell something" protocol that uses DIDComm Messaging as its foundation.* Alice's agent then gets two key pieces of information from Bob, typically by [resolving Bob's DID Doc](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#resolution):

- An endpoint (web, email, etc) where messages can be delivered to Bob.
- The public key that Bob's agent is using in the Alice:Bob relationship.

Now Alice's agent uses Bob's public key to [encrypt the plaintext](#message-encryption) so that only Bob's agent can read it, adding authentication with its own private key. The agent arranges delivery to Bob. This "arranging" can involve various hops and intermediaries. It can be complex. (See [Routing in the DIDComm Guidebook](https://didcomm.org/book/v2/routing).)

Bob's agent eventually receives and decrypts the message, authenticating its sender as Alice using her public key. It looks up this key in Alice's DID doc, and captures an endpoint for her at the same time. Bob's agent then prepares its response and routes it back using a reciprocal process (plaintext &rarr; encrypt with authentication &rarr; arrange delivery).

That's the essence, in the most common scenarios. However, it does not fit all DIDComm Messaging interactions:

- DIDComm doesn't always involve turn-taking and request-response.
- DIDComm interactions can involve more than 2 parties, and the parties are not always individuals.
- DIDComm may include formats other than JSON.

Before we provide more details, let's explore what drives the design of DIDComm Messaging.
