## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of DIDComm is to provide a secure, private communication methodology built atop the decentralized design of Decentralized Identifiers, also known as [DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

Other robust mechanisms for secure communication already exist. However, most rely on key registries, identity providers, certificate authorities, browser or app vendors, or similarly centralized assumptions. They also tend to be tied to a single transport, making it difficult to use the same solution for human and machine conversations, online and offline, simplex and duplex, across a broad set of modalities. The net result is that they perpetuate an asymmetry between institutions and ordinary people. The former maintain certificates and always-connected servers, and publish APIs under terms and conditions they dictate; the latter suffer with usernames and passwords, poor interoperability, and a Hobson's choice between privacy and convenience.

DIDComm can fix this. Using DIDComm, individuals on semi-connected mobile devices become full peers of highly available web servers operated by IT experts. Registration is self-service, intermediaries require little trust, and no terms and conditions apply.

DIDComm enables higher-order protocols that inherit its security, privacy, decentralization, and transport independence. Examples include exchanging verifiable credentials, creating and maintaining relationships, buying and selling, scheduling events, negotiating contracts, voting, presenting tickets for travel, applying to employers or schools or banks, arranging healthcare, and playing games. Like web services atop HTTP, the possibilities are endless; unlike web services atop HTTP, many parties can participate without being clients of a central server, and they can use a mixture of connectivity models and technologies.

### Rough Overview

A typical DIDComm interaction works like this:

> Imagine Alice wants to negotiate with Bob to sell something online, and that DIDComm, not direct human communication, is involved. This means Alice's agent and Bob's agent are going to exchange a series of messages.
>
> Alice may just press a button and be unaware of details, but underneath, her agent begins by preparing a plaintext JSON message about the proposed sale. (The particulars are irrelevant here, but would be described in the spec for a "sell something" protocol.) It then looks up Bob's DID Doc to access two key pieces of information:
>
> - An endpoint (web, email, etc) where messages can be delivered to Bob.
> - The public key that Bob's agent is using in the Alice:Bob relationship.
>
> Now Alice's agent uses Bob's public key to encrypt the plaintext so that only Bob's agent can read it, adding authentication with its own private key. The agent arranges delivery to Bob. This "arranging" can involve various hops and intermediaries. It can be complex.
>
> Bob's agent eventually receives and decrypts the message, authenticating its origin as Alice using her public key. It prepares its response and routes it back using a reciprocal process (plaintext -> lookup endpoint and public key for Alice -> encrypt with authentication -> arrange delivery).

That's it.

Well, mostly. The description is pretty good, if you squint, but it does not fit all DIDComm interactions:

- DIDComm doesn't always involve turn-taking and request-response.
- DIDComm interactions can involve more than 2 parties, and the parties are not always individuals.
- DIDComm may include formats other than JSON. {FTD: why make this expansion.  Seems to me if you focused the effort on building atop JWM you create a "waist" that will simplify discussions and speed adoption.   And yes, JWM could map to any number of underlying transport protocols (e.g. SMTP, HTTPS, etc)

Before we provide more details, let's explore what drives the design of DIDComm.

### Goals and Ramifications

The DIDComm design attempts to be:

1. **Secure**
2. **Private**
3. **Interoperable**
4. **Transport-agnostic**
5. **Extensible**

As a list of buzz words, this may elicit nods rather than surprise. However, several items have deep ramifications.

Taken together, *Secure* and *Private* require that the protocol be decentralized and maximally opaque to the surveillance economy. {I dont agree with this claim.  Yes, security and privacy can be achieved with a decentralized approach.  Security CAN be achieved in a centralized architecture, and (arguabily) so can privacy (depending on how you choose to define the term).  However, by definition this is a communications layer atop a DID architecture so by definition it's decentralized.}

*Interoperable* means that DIDComm should work across programming languages, blockchains, vendors, OS/platforms, networks, legal jurisdictions, geos, cryptographies, and hardware--as well as across time. That's quite a list. It means that DIDComm intends something more than just compatibility within any specific project; it aims to be a future-proof *lingua franca* of all self-sovereign interactions.

*Transport-agnostic* means that it should be possible to use DIDComm over HTTP(S) 1.x and 2.0, WebSockets, IRC, Bluetooth, AMQP, NFC, Signal, email, push notifications to mobile devices, Ham radio, multicast, snail mail, carrier pigeon, and more.

All software design involves tradeoffs. These goals, prioritized as shown, lead down an interesting path.

#### Message-Based, Asynchronous, and Simplex

The dominant paradigm in mobile and web development today is duplex request-response. You call an API with certain inputs, and you get back a response with certain outputs over the same channel, shortly thereafter. This is the world of [OpenAPI (Swagger)](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/), and it has many virtues.

Unfortunately, many agents are not good analogs to web servers. They may be mobile devices that turn off at unpredictable intervals and that lack a stable connection to the network. They may need to work peer-to-peer, when the internet is not available. They may need to interact in time frames of hours or days, not with 30-second timeouts. They may not listen over the same channel that they use to talk.

Because of this, the fundamental paradigm for DIDComm is message-based, asynchronous, and simplex. Agent X sends a message over channel A. Sometime later, it may receive a response from Agent Y over channel B. This is much closer to an email paradigm than a web paradigm.

On top of this foundation, it is possible to build elegant, synchronous request-response interactions. All of us have interacted with a friend who's emailing or texting us in near-realtime. However, interoperability begins with a least-common-denominator assumption that's simpler.

#### Message-Level Security, Reciprocal Authentication

The security and privacy goals, and the asynchronous+simplex design decision, break familiar web assumptions in another way. Servers are commonly run by institutions, and we authenticate them with certificates. People and things are usually authenticated to servers by some sort of login process quite different from certificates, and this authentication is cached in a session object that expires. Furthermore, web security is provided at the transport level (TLS); it is not an independent attribute of the messages themselves.

In a partially disconnected world where a communication channel is not assumed to support duplex request-response, and where the security can't be ignored as a transport problem, traditional TLS, login, and expiring sessions are impractical. Furthermore, centralized servers and certificate authorities perpetuate a power and UX imbalance between servers and clients that doesn't fit with the peer-oriented DIDComm.

DIDComm uses public key cryptography, not certificates from some parties and passwords from others. Its security guarantees are independent of the transport over which it flows. It is sessionless (though sessions can *easily* be built atop it). When authentication is required, all parties do it the same way.
